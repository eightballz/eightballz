## ðŸ‘‹ Salut!

I am a student from Pennsylvania who loves to make cool things! I also love running and biking in my free time.

I am currently of intermediate knowledge in Kotlin, Java, HTML, CSS, and I know some JS, and I am eager to learn even more languages!

I used to make Minecraft Servers, but have moved on to web development projects and building small communities

## ðŸ“‹ Current Projects

- Xaris Nation Game: A fully web-based nation roleplay game where you simulate a nation's population, infrastructure, economy, diplomacy, and military all through an online interface with other players!
- Infinity Worldbuilding Project: A worldbuilding project simulating a world much like Earth with thirty fantasy nations.
- Infinivision Song Contest: A community-driven spin-off of the Eurovision Song Contest based on the nations in the Infinity Worldbuilding Project that occurs monthly.
